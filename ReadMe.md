# Bitcoin Price Prediction with LSTM Network

Today we will learn how to gather our data to train and test our model with `Pandas Data Reader` library and then we will see how we can build a model with **LSTM network** using python and predicting the price of Bitcoin.



For sure you can use this model for any kind of Crypto or Stock data.
By the way, you can improve the model that I write by doing these steps:
* Increase or decrease the hidden layers
* Increase or decrease the Units per each layer
* Using other types of layers or changing the activation function of the layers
* Train more the model with diffrent batch size or more/less epochs and see what will happen

Have fun üëç
